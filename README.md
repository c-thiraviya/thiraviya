This Jupyter Notebook analyzes heart disease prediction using machine learning. It loads and preprocesses data, applying scaling and encoding techniques. Several models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVC, and XGBoost, are trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn help in data analysis. Additionally, a simple GUI using Tkinter is included for user interaction.
